    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> [Insert Date]</p>
    <p>[App Name] ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your data when you use our application ("App").</p>
    
    <h2>1. Information Collection and Use</h2>
    <p>Our App does <strong>not</strong> collect, store, or share any personal data. All user-generated data, such as bookmarks, comments, last read verses, and other preferences, are stored <strong>locally</strong> on your device using an SQLite database. We do not transmit, process, or share this data with any third parties.</p>
    
    <h2>2. Internet Connection</h2>
    <p>Our App operates <strong>mostly offline</strong>. However, an internet connection is required for playing audio recitations. Other features, such as bookmarks, comments, and last read verses, are stored locally on your device, and no user data is uploaded or transmitted over the internet.</p>
    
    <h2>3. No Advertisements</h2>
    <p>We do not display advertisements in the App. There are no third-party trackers, analytics tools, or any mechanisms that collect user information.</p>
    
    <h2>4. Permissions</h2>
    <p>Our App may request storage permissions solely for the purpose of storing user preferences, such as bookmarks and comments, within your device. We do not access any other personal data or files.</p>
    
    <h2>5. Data Security</h2>
    <p>Since all data is stored locally on your device, the security of your information depends on your device's security measures. We recommend using standard security practices such as device encryption and password protection.</p>
    
    <h2>6. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected in this document, and the latest version will always be available on our <a href="https://your-github-username.github.io/privacy-policy">GitHub Pages</a>. Your continued use of the App after any modifications signifies your acceptance of the updated policy.</p>
